                <hr>
                <p class="theText">
                    In the middle of 2021, I created the character 一只白福福 and became a game-related content creator.
                </p>

                <p class="theText">
                    I stream play video games, make funny video clips, as well as game walkthrough videos.
                </p>

                <p class="theText">
                    Although I haven't a bunch of fans so far, I have gained a lot of like-minded viewers and good
                    feedback with the video, so I would love to keep doing it.
                </p>

                <p class="theText">
                    I started to make video game walkthroughs due to a coincidence. Some of my viewers found that I
                    always grow and learn very fast when playing Souls-like games and usually beat bosses in a strange
                    way, so they asked me to record them. Therefore, I decided to record and add some explanations to
                    them and share my ideas. And I think I somehow did a good job since those kinds of videoes usually
                    get 10k views.

                    <h5>One trick to defeat Demon of Hatred:</h5>
                    <hr>
                    <p class="theText">
                        This video is about the strategies to defeat the Demon of Hatred in SEKIRO: shadows die twice.
                        Demon of Hatred is a hidden boss in SEKIRO, and it is also considered the strongest boss of the
                        game.
                    </p>
                    <p class="theText">
                        When I kept being beaten, I analyzed Demon of Hatred's attack movements, attack range, and
                        timing. Then I found one of his weaknesses - he has a skill that is easy to counter and used in
                        all the stages. In addition, other skills are relatively easy to bypass.
                    </p>
                    <p class="theText">
                        So I made my discovery into a video. Firstly, I categorized his skills based on the
                        stages(00:42). And then focused on explaining the weakness skill and how to counter it (1:00).
                        Finally, I listed all the other skills by showing and summarizing other skills, and other
                        counter methods(after2:30).

                <h5>Why I am doing this?</h5>
                <hr>
                <p class="theText">
                    I think it is important to experience plenty of games in different genres, as a game
                    designer.However, it is hard to keep playing every day. Also, I wouldn't say I like every game
                    genre.
                </p>
                <p class="theText">
                    Therefore, I decided to stream while I was playing. On the one hand, I have some "promises" to the
                    audience about my streaming schedule, so I will try my best to keep up with it. On the other hand,
                    chatting with the audience is interesting, especially while the game I was playing was not that
                    attractive.
                </p>

            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-4 md-auto">
                <h5>What it's bring?</h5>
                <hr>
                <p class="theText">
                    About live streaming, first of all, sharing my analysis of the game with the audience can help me
                    sort out my ideas more clearly. At the same time, I can collect ideas from my audience, they are
                    usually also players.
                </p>
                <p class="theText">
                    Secondly, I will have some motivation to try out games that I had never tried before, but my
                    audience did. I only played single-player and indie games, but my audiences generally want to watch
                    AAA games, so now I play them all.
                </p>
                <p class="theText">
                    In addition, the tips and subscriptions from the audience, although not enough to count as a
                    reliable income, are enough to cover the games. To some extent, I can play games for free :3 </p>
                <p class="theText">
                    Finally, by making walkthrough videos, I forced myself to study the boss's actions and skills in
                    more depth which has greatly improved my knowledge of 3D action and skill designs. At the same time,
                    In order to make better videos, I have to keep learning Adobe Pr, Ps, and other image and video
                    editing software. </p>
